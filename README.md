# PROJECT NAME
In this project, we were implementing an authentication system using 'Devise.'
So users can only access areas of the site they are authorized to access.

## Built With
- Ruby on Rails
- Ruby
- Devise

## Getting Started
To get a local copy of the repository, please run the following commands on your terminal:
`$ cd <folder>`
`$ git clone git@github.com:MarkoNS1990/members_only.git`
`$ cd members_only`
> Run bundle
> `$ bundle install`
> Setup the database `$ rails db:setup`
> Run the rails server `$ rails server`
> In your browser, navigate to posts/new; you need to be registered to create a post `http://localhost:3000/posts/new`
> You can log in with the existing user email: test@test.com and password: 123456 or register a new account, click on 'register,' then you will be able to create a new post.
Otherwise, if you are not logged in, you will be able to see posts authors. You can check all posts with`http://localhost:3000.`
